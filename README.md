## AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
- **AI Chat & Insights**: Public chat widget and AI insights panel powered by Amazon Bedrock via Amplify Gen 2 generation routes.

## AI Feature Requirements

The AI chat widget (`PublicChatWidget`) and AI insights panel (`AiInsightsPanel`) use the `generateRecipe` generation route defined in `amplify/data/resource.ts`. This route calls **Claude 3.5 Haiku** via Amazon Bedrock.

### Required setup before deploying the AI features

1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock model access** in the AWS Console for the region you deploy to (default: `us-east-1`):
   - Go to **Amazon Bedrock → Model access** and enable **Claude 3.5 Haiku** (Anthropic).
2. **Deploy or sandbox the Amplify backend** so the `generateRecipe` AppSync mutation and the Bedrock Lambda resolver are provisioned:
   ```bash
   npx ampx sandbox          # for local development
   # or push via CI/CD for production
   ```
3. After a successful deployment, Amplify CLI regenerates `amplify/amplify_outputs.json`. This file **must** contain a `generations.generateRecipe` entry inside `data.model_introspection`. Without it, the frontend Amplify client cannot expose `client.generations.generateRecipe` and will display a user-friendly error in the UI instead of crashing.

### Environment variables

The Amplify outputs file (`amplify/amplify_outputs.json`) provides the AppSync endpoint and API key automatically — no extra frontend env vars are needed under normal operation.

`amplify_outputs.json` is regenerated on every CI/CD build: `npx ampx pipeline-deploy --outputs-out-dir amplify` writes a fresh copy to `amplify/amplify_outputs.json` before the frontend build (`npm run build`) runs, so the deployed app always uses the current API key.  For local development, run `npx ampx sandbox` or `npx ampx generate outputs --outputs-out-dir amplify` to regenerate the file.

> **Important — common auth error cause**: If `amplify.yml` runs `npx ampx pipeline-deploy` *without* the `--outputs-out-dir amplify` flag, the outputs file is written to the project root (`./amplify_outputs.json`) instead of `amplify/amplify_outputs.json`.  Because `src/main.tsx` imports from `amplify/amplify_outputs.json`, the frontend build then uses the stale, git-committed key and every user sees the "authorization error" message.  The fix is already applied in `amplify.yml`.

**Optional override variables** — set these in the AWS Amplify Console (App settings → Environment variables) or in a local `.env.local` file when `amplify_outputs.json` has a stale key (e.g. if CI/CD has not yet run after a backend change):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_APPSYNC_URL` | Override the AppSync GraphQL endpoint URL |
| `VITE_APPSYNC_API_KEY` | Override the AppSync API key |

See `.env.example` for a template.

The AppSync API key is provisioned with a 365-day lifetime and is automatically rotated on each backend deployment.

For the backend Lambda functions that connect to the RDS database, the following secrets must be set in Amplify (App settings → Secrets):

| Secret name | Description              |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| `DB_HOST`   | MySQL host               |
| `DB_USER`   | MySQL username           |
| `DB_PASS`   | MySQL password           |
| `DB_NAME`   | MySQL database name      |
| `DB_PORT`   | MySQL port (default 3306)|
